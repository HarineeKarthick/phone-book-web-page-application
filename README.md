# phone-book-web-page-application
A simple phonebook application using html,css,php
This application helps the user to store the person's contact number, name, email id, etc into the database
html and css are used for front end and for the backend I have used php and mysql.
The user of this application can perform the following things:
(a) store
(b) view contact info
(c) delete contact info
(d) edit contact info
I have used XAMPP server and editor tools to create this application.
